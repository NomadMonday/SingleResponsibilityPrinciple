## Summary
- I created this project as a demonstration of the Single Responsibility Principle (the S in SOLID).
- It is a recreation of this demonstration by Tim Corey, except rewritten in Python: https://youtu.be/5RwhyZnVRS8
- I wanted to create a semi-guided exercise where the objective is known, but the exact solution is not due to language differences. In this way, I could create a more challenging and engaging problem to solve, while also learning how to apply SOLID principles in Python.
- The Begin folder contains the starting point of the code before the principle is applied, and the End folder contains the refactored code after.

## Notes
- A key difference between C# and Python that I ran into in this project, is that C# requires everything to be within a class while Python does not. So with the Python version, I was able to more simply package related functions into a module instead of creating classes to hold them.
