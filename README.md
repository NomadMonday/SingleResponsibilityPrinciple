### Summary
- This project is a demonstration of the Single Responsibility Principle (the S in SOLID).
- It is a recreation of this demonstration by Tim Corey, except rewritten in Python: https://youtu.be/5RwhyZnVRS8
- The purpose of this project was to create a semi-guided exercise, where the objective is defined, but the answer is not since it's in a different language. The challenge of the exercise being to learn how to apply SOLID principles in Python.
- The Begin folder contains the starting point of the code before the principle is applied, and the End folder contains the refactored code after.

### Notes
- A key difference between C# and Python that is apparent in this project, is that C# requires everything to be within a class while Python does not.
- So with the Python version, we can more simply package related functions into a module instead of creating classes to hold them.
