This project is a demonstration of the Single Responsibility Principle (the S in SOLID).

It is a recreation of this demonstration by Tim Corey, except rewritten in Python: https://youtu.be/5RwhyZnVRS8

The Begin folder contains the starting point of the code before the principle is applied, and the End folder contains the refactored code after.
